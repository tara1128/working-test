It is fun and easy, it goes fast slow and just right, it is the perfect game for little ones to play. It gets them happy to learn music while playing a great game.";
$SoPlayerStory3 = "I play it during work time, on toilet, etc. Great songs, getting hard gradually, high speed, they are the reason why I like it. Overall, a good experience, and of course a good game. Would recommend to all the people who wish they could make piano music, but cannot achieve the goal in real life, because pianos are expensive, whilst this game is free.";
$SoPlayerStory4 = "This game is really, really good. If you haven't tried it, then you obviously have missed something terrific... For goodness sake it's a piano sliding and making me wanna learn now more about it. The music is so lovely you have to move your fingers a lot and go up and up to achieve higher levels. The best game ever.";
